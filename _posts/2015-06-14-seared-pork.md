description: "A classic pork roast and mashed potatoes recipe, this is elegant in its simplicity and sophisticated flavour."
ingredients: {
  "potatoes": "400g",
  "spring onion": "3 bunches",
  "lemon": 1,
  "crème fraîche": "1/4 cup",
  "pork roast": 1,
  "spinach": "150g"
}
method: [
  "Put a medium pot of water on to boil while preparing the fresh produce: largely dice the potatoes; discard the roots of the spring onions and thinly slice them, dividing the white bottoms and greeen tops; and zest the lemon, then quarter and de-seed it.",
  "Add the potatoes to the boiling water, and cook for 10 minutes. Drain thoroughly and return to the pot, removing from the heat. Use a fork to smash to the desired consistency, then add the crème fraîche, half the green tops of the spring onions, half the lemon zest, and the juice of two lemon wedges. Drizzle with olive oil and stir to combine, seasoning with salt and pepper.",
  "While the potatoes cook, heat 2 tsp of olive oil in a large pan until hot. Season the pork with salt and pepper on both sides, then add to the pan and loosely cover with aluminium foil. Cook, flipping occasionally, for 12 to 15 minutes or until browned. Transfer pork to a clean work surface and let rest for at least 5 minutes, leaving fond in the pan.",
  "While the pork rests, add 1 tsp of olive oil to the pan with fond, and heat on medium until hot. Add the spring onion bottoms and lemon zest, then cook, stirring constantly for a minute. Remove from heat.",
  "Slice pork against the grain, then serve next to cooked spinach and potatoes, garnishing with pepper and the remaining green spring onions tops and lemon wedges."

Add olives or fresh herbs to the mashed potato for a bit of a flavour twist.
