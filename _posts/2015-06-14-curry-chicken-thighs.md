description: "With some of the heat taken out of the original recipe, this chicken is now delightfully reminiscent of a hotter dish, without the spice"
ingredients: {
  "fingerling potatoes": "225g",
  "sugar snap peas": "175g",
  "English cucumber": "1/2",
  "lemon": 1,
  "mint": "1 bunch",
  "ginger": "2cm piece",
  "chicken thighs": 2,
  "curry powder": "1 Tbsp",
  "greek yoghurt": "1/2 cup"
}
method: [
  "Preheat oven to 240°C (475°F), while preparing the fresh produce: cut the potatoes lengthwise into 2cm wide wedges; trim off the end of each sugar snap pea; finely slice the cucumber; quarter and deseed the lemon; pick the mint leaves off their stems; and finely mince the ginger.",
  "Place the potatoes on a sheet pan, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper, tossing to coat. Arrange in a single layer and roast for 15 minutes.",
  "While the potatoes roast, pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels, seasoning with salt, pepper, and half the curry powder. In a medium pan, heat 2 tsp of olive oil on medium until hot, then cook, loosely covered in aluminium foil, for 9 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate, leaving fond in pan.",
  "While the chicken cooks, combine cucumber, yoghurt and the juice of two lemon wedges in a medium bowl.",
  "Add 2 tsp of olive oil to the pan of fond, and heat on medium high until hot. Add the ginger and remaining curry powder, then cook, stirring frequently, for a minute. Add the sugar snap peas, roasted potatoes, and 2 Tbsp of water. Cook for another 2 minutes and remove from heat.",
  "Roughly chop the mint, then add it and the juice of the remaining lemon juices to the vegetables, seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.",
  "Serve vegetables and chicken together, with a large spoonful of yoghurt atop both."

For those determined to have some heat, replace the mild curry powder with
Madras curry powder.
