  "Spray the bundt pan with olive oil non-stick spray, then dust lightly with flour.",
  "In a very large bowl, mix together flour, caster sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, and allspice. Once thoroughly combined, make a well in the centre and add oil, honey, brown sugar, eggs, orange juice, and vanilla. Mix until well combined.",
  "Pour batter into prepared bundt pan, and bake until the cake is set and springs bake when touched gently in the centre (approximately 70 minutes). If cake browns too early, cover with aluminium foil to prevent burning.",

For a more adult cake, replace a quarter of a cup of orange juice with your choice of alcohol (orange or coffee liqueurs work well, as does whisky).
